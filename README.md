# liri-bot
use APIs with NODE

Simply cd into your liri-bot directory, and enter node liri2.js (liri.js is unfinished*)
followed by one of the following:

 -- spotify-this-song (song title)
 -- movie-this (movie title)
 -- concert-this (musical artist)
 -- do-what-it-says (takes inputs from random.txt instead of line input)
 
 Much terminal, very information, so javascript.
